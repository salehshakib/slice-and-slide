## ‚ú® Features

- **Create Boxes:** Click and drag on the canvas to draw new colored rectangles of any size.
- **Slice Dynamically:** Simply click anywhere on the canvas. A crosshair follows your mouse, and your click slices all existing boxes both horizontally and vertically along those lines.
- **Minimum Size:** Slicing is prevented if it would result in a piece smaller than 10x10 pixels, keeping the canvas clean and manageable.
- **Drag & Drop:** Easily move and rearrange any sliced piece by clicking and dragging it.
- **Reset Canvas:** A convenient reset button instantly clears the canvas, allowing you to start fresh.
- **Responsive Design:** The canvas adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Create a box**: Press your mouse button down on the canvas, drag to define the size, and release.
2.  **Slice boxes**: Move your mouse to position the red crosshair guides. Click to slice all shapes along those guides.
3.  **Move a piece**: Click and hold on any piece, drag it to a new position, and release.
4.  **Start over**: Click the "Reset" button (the counter-clockwise arrow) in the top-right corner.
